# Rust Lib in Swift
A basic Rust static library for any Swift project supporting various Apple platforms such as iOS, iOS Simulator, macOS, and mac Catalyst for both Intel and Apple silicon. In it you'll see a wrapper library mapping Rust's API to Swift by a C bridge header which contains a function **rust_munchausen_numbers()** that takes no arguments but returns a tuple containing four Int32 types showing [The MÃ¼nchhausen Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_digit-to-digit_invariant).
